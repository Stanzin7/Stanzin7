<h3 align="center">About me</h3>

I have an addictive personality, and for a long time that worked against me — because I was addicted to drugs.  
I didn’t care about anything meaningful until I met **Shelby Davis**, my sponsor and my hero.

I made a bet with him. I told him I would become a billionaire. He chuckled, looked at me, and said, *“I believe in you.”*  
That moment meant more to me than I can explain — and since then, everything changed.

I was a drug addict in high school and college. I graduated with one of the lowest GPAs. I had no direction, no discipline, and no belief that I mattered. 
I say this plainly because I want people to know **it doesn’t define you**. Where you start does not decide where you end. You can become who you want to 
be — if you work hard, and if even a few people believe in you.

I’m deeply inspired by Shelby Davis’ **“Learn, Earn, and Return”** philosophy. I miss him deeply. He is my hero — the one person I truly wanted to meet in this world. 
I promised him I would keep moving forward, and I will. I’ve been funding open source since my first Google Summer of Code internship, and I’m committed to carrying that 
legacy through open-source sustainability, mentorship, and helping others find their path.

The most important lesson I’ve learned is that you can’t do this alone. The world is cruel, and you need to build a **crew** — people you trust, people who tell you the truth, 
people who keep you on the right path when you drift. Shelby was that for me, and others stepped in too. That’s how momentum survives.

I will become a billionaire. If I can say that out loud, why not you?
Say it after me: I will become ____.

Life is short. Don’t be afraid. Make connections. Spread kindness.
